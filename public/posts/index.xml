      <description>While managing my homelab, I quickly ran into a major challenge: handling secrets securely in a GitOps workflow. With Kubernetes and GitOps tools like Flux, all configurations—including secrets—are stored in a Git repository. However, committing secrets in plaintext is a security risk, and even base64-encoded secrets (as Kubernetes does by default) can be easily decoded.&#xA;After some research online, I quickly settled on SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) with Age for encryption. This happened to be the best place to start for me.</description>
